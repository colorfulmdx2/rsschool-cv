## About me
I am very motivated by working on interesting projects, solving interesting and complex problems. I prefer to spend my free time with friends or reading books, as well as technical documentation of various libraries and frameworks. I visit the gym 4 times a week, it can be called a hobby or passion, it helps to refresh my head when it boils from work :)
